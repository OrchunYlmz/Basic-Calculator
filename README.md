# Basic-Calculator

This is a simple calculator program written in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, root, exponential functions.

## Features
-Addition: Adds two numbers.
-Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
-Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
-Division: Divides the first number by the second.
-Root: Computes the nth root of the first number.
-Exponential: Raises the first number to the power of the second.

## Getting Started
To run this program, you'll need Python installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

## Example

Here's a quick example of how to use the calculator:

    First Number: 5
    + 
    - 
    * 
    / 
    ** 
    r
    Pick one of the symbols above: +
    Second Number: 3
    5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0
    Type 'y' to continue calculating with 8.0, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: n



## Code Explanation
- Operations Functions: Functions for each arithmetic operation.

  - add(n1, n2): Returns the sum of n1 and n2.
  - sub(n1, n2): Returns the difference when n2 is subtracted from n1.
  - multiply(n1, n2): Returns the product of n1 and n2.
  - divide(n1, n2): Returns the quotient of n1 divided by n2.
  - root(n1, n2): Returns the n2th root of n1.
  - expo(n1, n2): Returns n1 raised to the power of n2.

- Calculator Function: The main function that drives the calculator program.

  - Prompts the user for input.
  - Displays available operations.
  - Performs the chosen operation and prints the result.
  - Allows the user to continue with the result or start a new calculation.

## Note
In the future, this code will include basic derivative calculations, basic integral calculations, and basic limit calculations.
